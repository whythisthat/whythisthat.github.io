# Software Design and Engineering

## Artifact: Rescue Animal System

The artifact featured on this page is the **Rescue Animal System** application, which was initially developed during my Computer Science program at SNHU. This application was designed to manage the intake, reservation, and status of rescue animals such as dogs and monkeys. It includes functionalities for adding new animals, reserving them, and printing lists of animals based on specific criteria. The application is implemented using object-oriented programming principles and provides a console-based menu system for user interaction.

### Justification for Inclusion

I selected this artifact for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it effectively demonstrates several core competencies in software development. These competencies include:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The application uses OOP principles to design and implement classes that represent different types of animals and the operations that can be performed on them.
- **Data Handling:** The application efficiently manages data related to animal intake, reservations, and status updates, showcasing my ability to work with and manipulate data structures.
- **User Interaction:** The console-based menu system allows users to interact with the application, making it user-friendly while demonstrating my skills in designing user interfaces for software.

### Enhancements Made

The Rescue Animal System was improved in the following ways:

1. **Comprehensive Input Validation and Error Handling:**
   - Enhanced the application's robustness by implementing input validation to ensure that all user inputs are correct.
   - Added error handling to gracefully manage exceptions, preventing the application from crashing due to invalid inputs.

2. **Support for Additional Animal Types:**
   - Extended the application's functionality by adding support for new animal types, such as birds and reptiles.
   - Created new classes for these animal types and updated the Driver class to include menu options and methods for their intake, reservation, and printing.

### Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Enhancing and modifying this artifact was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of software engineering principles. During the enhancement process, I learned the following:

- **Input Validation and Error Handling:** I improved my understanding of these crucial techniques, which are essential for building reliable and user-friendly software applications.
- **Design Flexibility:** Adding new animal types required careful consideration of the application's design to ensure that it remained flexible and maintainable. This process involved critical thinking and problem-solving to integrate new features without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges I encountered was ensuring seamless integration of the new classes for birds and reptiles with the existing application structure. This required careful planning and extensive testing to prevent bugs or regressions. Additionally, balancing robust error handling with a smooth user experience was a key challenge, as I needed to ensure that the application remained user-friendly while being resilient to invalid inputs.

### Achievement of Course Outcomes

Through this enhancement, I successfully met the course outcomes I had set out to achieve. Specifically:

- **Innovative Techniques and Skills:** I demonstrated my ability to use innovative techniques and skills to implement design solutions and achieve industry-specific goals.
- **Software Engineering and Design Proficiency:** The enhancements highlight my proficiency in software engineering and design, as well as my ability to produce professional-quality written and visual communications through the improved code and accompanying narrative.

Overall, this enhancement process allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context, refine my coding skills, and produce a more robust and feature-rich application that aligns with industry standards.
